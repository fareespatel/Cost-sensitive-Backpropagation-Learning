# Cost-sensitive-Backpropagation-Learning
Trained a cost-sensitive backpropagation network on Wheet seeds dataset

Many classification problems have asymmetric costs associated with errors of different kinds. I explored how misclassification costs can be taken into account in training a backprop network, and apply on the UCI wheet seeds dataset to improve the FPR
